Comprehensive Database Management Task: Library Management System
Objective: Create a complete database management system for a library, covering design, implementation, querying, optimization, and security.

Task Breakdown
Database Design

Create a Relational Database Schema:
Design tables for:
Books: BookID, Title, PublicationYear, ISBN, Genre
Authors: AuthorID, Name, Birthdate
Members: MemberID, Name, MembershipDate, Email
Loans: LoanID, BookID, MemberID, LoanDate, ReturnDate
Define relationships:
A book can have multiple authors (Many-to-Many).
A member can borrow multiple books (One-to-Many).
Specify primary keys and foreign keys.
SQL Query Writing

Write SQL queries to perform the following:
Retrieve all books along with their authors.
Find all members who borrowed books in the last month.
Calculate the average number of books borrowed per member.
List the top 5 most borrowed books.
Database Normalization

Normalize the Loans table if it contains redundant data (e.g., member details repeated with each loan).
Explain the normalization process and provide the resulting tables in at least 3NF.
Data Migration

Plan a migration from an existing flat-file system (CSV) to the newly designed relational database.
Create a mapping of fields from the CSV to the database tables.
Write a script (in Python or SQL) to perform the migration, ensuring data integrity.
Database Performance Tuning

Identify and optimize slow-running queries from the library database.
Use indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., BookID, MemberID).
Document the performance improvements by measuring execution times before and after optimization.
Backup and Recovery Strategy

Develop a backup strategy:
Schedule daily incremental backups and weekly full backups.
Use database tools (e.g., pg_dump for PostgreSQL or mysqldump for MySQL).
Create a recovery plan that details steps to restore the database from backups in case of failure.
Implementing Database Security

Identify security risks for the library database.
Implement user roles:
Admin: Full access to all tables.
Librarian: Access to books and loans tables.
Member: Access to their own data and loan history.
Enable encryption for sensitive data (e.g., member emails).
Document security measures taken and outline a plan for regular audits.
Deliverables
A complete database schema diagram.
SQL scripts for creating tables and relationships.
SQL queries as specified.
Documentation for the normalization process.
Data migration script and sample output.
Performance tuning report with before-and-after metrics.
Backup and recovery strategy document.
Security implementation report.
